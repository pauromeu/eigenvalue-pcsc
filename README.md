# Eigenvalue Computation Project

## Introduction
This project is dedicated to the implementation of numerical methods for eigenvalue computation. It targets matrices `A` and focuses on finding all scalars `Î»` (eigenvalues) that satisfy the equation:

$$ Ax = \lambda x $$

## Features
The project includes the following key features:

1. **Power Method**: 
   - This method is used to find the dominant eigenvalue of a matrix.

2. **Inverse Power Method**:
   - A technique for finding the smallest eigenvalue of a matrix.

3. **Power and Inverse Power Methods with Shift**:
   - An enhancement of the basic methods, incorporating a shift to accelerate convergence.

4. **QR Method**:
   - An algorithm to compute all eigenvalues of a matrix by decomposing it into a product of an orthogonal matrix `Q` and an upper triangular matrix `R`.


## Building the Project

### Prerequisites
Before building, ensure you have the following installed:
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- A C++ compiler compatible with CMake (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)

### Building Instructions


   Run the following command in the root directory of the project to create a build directory and generate the necessary build files:
   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build
   ```
   Build the files in the build folder:
   ```bash
   cmake --build build
   ```

### Running the project

   After a successful build, you can find the executable in the build directory. Navigate there and run it:
   
   ```bash
   cd build
    ./Eigenvalue-PCSC
   ```

   In the same directory, run the executable generated to run the tets:
   ```bash
    ./Eigenvalue-PCSC-tests
   ```
